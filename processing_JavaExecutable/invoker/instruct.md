You can now download an unstable java executable UI for Windows: [here for 64-bit](https://github.com/cosmicbhejafry/poem-to-FSM/tree/main/processing_JavaExecutable/invoker/application.windows64) or [here for 32-bit](https://github.com/cosmicbhejafry/poem-to-FSM/tree/main/processing_JavaExecutable/invoker/application.windows32).

## Read before using the executable:

1. Make sure the URL you input is a **Poetry Foundation** URL. 

2. Make sure it has text and not an embedded image/pdf. 
   For example: [a URL which will work well](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57325/sonnet-in-search-of-an-author), 
                [a URL which won't work at all](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=29944)  

3. If a node is highlighted- tap the 'v' key to hear the word represented by the node. You can drag the nodes around by pressing on the left mouse button.
